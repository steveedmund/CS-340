CS-340 Project

How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
I write maintainable, readable, and adaptable programs by creating modular solutions and documenting the code I create. The advantage of modular code solutions is being able to identify faulty components and reuse solutions easily.
How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
As a computer scientist, I approached the client request by breaking the problem down, in this case, the client request, and used solutions available such as Pymongo to streamline the solution. My approach was different in that I was allowed to make some design decisions. In the future, I would prefer to work with NoSQL databases to fulfill client requests.
What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company like Grazioso Salvare to do their work better?
Computer scientists use knowledge of the inner workings of program-defined behavior to solve problems. It matters because it is work that uses the intersection of creativity and science to improve computers and what they do. Work like this project's database and dashboard design could help locate important information quickly.
